Specifically, its Accuracy_Mean was 0.999997, Recall_Mean was 0.999995, and F1_Mean was 0.999997. The standard deviations for these metrics were non-zero but still very small (e.g., 0.000005 for Accuracy_Std). Its Precision_Mean was 1.0 with a standard deviation of 0.0.\n","\n","### Strengths and Weaknesses:\n","\n","*   **MLP and LSTM (Strengths):** Both models exhibit outstanding performance, achieving near-perfect classification on this dataset. Their consistency (zero standard deviation) across folds suggests robustness. The LSTM, designed for sequential data, doesn't show a clear advantage over MLP here, possibly because the 'timesteps' dimension was set to 1, effectively treating each sample independently, or because the features themselves are not highly sequential in nature within this specific representation.\n","*   **Autoencoder-Classifier (Strengths):** Despite slightly lower overall scores, the Autoencoder-Classifier still performs exceptionally well. Its approach of learning a compressed, meaningful representation of the data (latent features) and then using a simpler classifier (Logistic Regression) on these features is a strength, especially in scenarios where dimensionality reduction or noise removal is crucial. The fact that it performs nearly as well as the direct classifiers suggests the latent features are highly discriminative.\n","*   **Potential Weaknesses/Considerations:** The near-perfect scores for all models could indicate several things:\n","    *   **Data Leakage:** There might be some form of data leakage in the features that makes the classification task unusually easy. This should be investigated further.\n","    *   **Simplicity of Task:** The cleaned and balanced dataset might represent a relatively simple classification problem for these advanced models.\n","    *   **Small Number of Epochs:** For LSTM and Autoencoder, only a small number of epochs (5 and 10, respectively) were used, yet they achieved perfect scores. This further hints at the simplicity of the task or potential leakage.\n","\n","### Conclusion:\n","\n","Based on the current evaluation, all three models perform exceptionally well, making it difficult to distinguish a clear"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"f3901a99"},"source":["## Final Task\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Provide a summary of the implemented models' performance, identifying the best-performing model(s) and confirming readiness to proceed with MRFO for feature selection as previously discussed.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a7d75f76"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Q&A\n","*   **Summary of the implemented models' performance:** All three implemented models (MLP, LSTM, and Autoencoder-Classifier) demonstrated exceptionally high classification performance. The MLP and LSTM models achieved perfect scores (mean 1.0000, std 0.0000) across all evaluated metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score). The Autoencoder-Classifier also performed remarkably well, with mean scores exceeding 0.99999 for all metrics (e.g., Accuracy_Mean: 0.999997, Precision_Mean: 1.0000, Recall_Mean: 0.999995, F1_Mean: 0.999997).\n","*   **Identifying the best-performing model(s):** Based on the evaluation, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are the best-performing, as both achieved perfect scores (1.0000) for all metrics with zero standard deviation, indicating flawless and consistent classification on the resampled dataset. The Autoencoder-Classifier was marginally behind but still delivered near-perfect results.\n","*   **Readiness to proceed with MRFO for feature selection:** While the models show perfect performance, this raises concerns about potential data leakage or the dataset representing an overly simple classification task. Before proceeding directly with MRFO for feature selection, it's crucial to investigate the reason for such high performance. If the perfect scores are validated and not due to an underlying issue, then the models are highly effective, and MRFO could still be beneficial for feature reduction or understanding feature importance, but the current performance doesn't suggest a *need* for better features from a pure predictive power standpoint.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","*   The data was successfully prepared for model training, including scaling of numerical features using `StandardScaler` and reshaping into a 3D format `(377186, 1, 51)` for LSTM models.\n","*   The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model achieved perfect classification performance across all 5-fold cross-validation iterations, with mean accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 1.0000 and a standard deviation of 0.0000 for each.\n","*   The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model also demonstrated perfect classification, achieving mean accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 1.0000, with a standard deviation of 0.0000 for each, matching the MLP's performance.\n","*   The Autoencoder-Classifier pipeline, which first learns latent features via an autoencoder and then classifies using Logistic Regression, achieved near-perfect scores, with a mean accuracy of 0.999997, precision of 1.0000, recall of 0.999995, and F1-score of 0.999997. The standard deviations for these metrics were very small (e.g., 0.000005 for accuracy), indicating high consistency.\n","*   The comparison across all three models highlighted their exceptionally high performance, making it difficult to differentiate them based purely on these metrics, especially between MLP and LSTM.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   Investigate the cause of the near-perfect performance across all models (MLP, LSTM, Autoencoder-Classifier). This could indicate data leakage, an overly simple problem, or highly separable classes in the preprocessed and resampled dataset, which should be understood before further optimization or feature selection.\n","*   If the perfect performance is validated, proceed with MRFO for feature selection, not necessarily to improve predictive power (as it's already maxed out), but potentially to identify the most critical features for interpretability, reduce model complexity, or optimize computational efficiency.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6141af73"},"source":["# Task\n","Prepare the data by using the one-hot encoded feature set (`X_encoded`) and the original imbalanced target variable (`y`), then split this data into training and testing sets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"994c3865"},"source":["## Prepare Data (without balancing)\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Use the one-hot encoded feature set (`X_encoded`) and the original target variable (`y`) directly, without applying SMOTE or any other balancing technique.

However, a slight nuance can be observed:\n","\n","*   **MLP (Unbalanced):** Achieved perfect scores (1.0000) for Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.\n","*   **LSTM (Unbalanced):** Also achieved perfect scores (1.0000) for Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.\n","*   **Autoencoder-Classifier (Unbalanced):** Showed a minor decrease in Accuracy and Precision compared to its balanced counterpart, with an Accuracy of 0.999925 and Precision of 0.99992. Recall and F1-Score remained very high at 1.0000 and 0.99996, respectively.\n","\n","### Highlighting Differences Compared to Balanced Results:\n","\n","When comparing these results to the models trained on the *balanced* dataset (where SMOTE was applied):\n","\n","*   **MLP and LSTM:** There is no discernible difference in performance. Both models achieved perfect scores (1.0000 for all metrics with 0.0000 standard deviation) on both the balanced and unbalanced datasets. This suggests that for this particular dataset and feature set, the class imbalance might not severely hinder the model's ability to classify, or the features are highly discriminative.\n","*   **Autoencoder-Classifier:** On the balanced data, the Autoencoder-Classifier had a mean Accuracy of 0.999997 and Precision of 1.0. On the unbalanced data, its Accuracy dropped slightly to 0.999925 and Precision to 0.99992. While still extremely high, this subtle decrease indicates that balancing the dataset did provide a marginal benefit for this model, particularly in terms of correctly identifying positive cases (as suggested by a slightly higher Precision on balanced data) or overall correct predictions.\n","\n","### Overall Conclusion on Unbalanced Data:\n","\n","The fact that MLP and LSTM achieve perfect scores even on the original imbalanced dataset further reinforces the earlier concern about potential data leakage or the inherent simplicity of the classification task given the current features. The Autoencoder-Classifier, while still performing excellently, is the only model that shows a very minor impact from the class imbalance, which is a more expected behavior. This comparison underscores the need for careful feature engineering or re-evaluation of the problem if such high scores are not aligned with expected real-world complexity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"92e358f1"},"source":["## Final Task\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Summarize the results of training and evaluating the models on the imbalanced dataset, provide insights into how class imbalance affects performance, and confirm readiness for the next steps.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ba208b22"},"source":["## Summary:\n","\n","### Q&A\n","The models (MLP, LSTM, and Autoencoder-Classifier) were trained and evaluated on an imbalanced dataset. The impact of class imbalance on performance was assessed by comparing these results to those obtained from balanced datasets (which were processed in a previous task not detailed here, but referred to in the comparison section). All models showed extremely high performance, with MLP and LSTM achieving perfect scores even on the imbalanced data. The Autoencoder-Classifier showed a very slight, but notable, decrease in Accuracy and Precision on the imbalanced data compared to its performance on balanced data. The analysis is ready for the next steps, but with a note of caution regarding the unusually high performance.\n","\n","### Data Analysis Key Findings\n","*   The original imbalanced dataset was successfully split into training and testing sets, resulting in `X_train_unbalanced` (160000 samples, 51 features) and `X_test_unbalanced` (40000 samples, 51 features).\n","*   Numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler`, and the data was reshaped for LSTM models, yielding `X_train_unbalanced_scaled_reshaped` (160000 samples, 1 timestep, 51 features) and `X_test_unbalanced_scaled_reshaped` (40000 samples, 1 timestep, 51 features).\n","*   **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) performance on unbalanced data:** The model achieved perfect metrics: Accuracy of 1.0000, Precision of 1.0000, Recall of 1.0000, and F1-Score of 1.0000.\n","*   **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) performance on unbalanced data:** The model also achieved perfect metrics: Accuracy of 1.0000, Precision of 1.0000, Recall of 1.0000, and F1-Score of 1.0000.\n","*   **Autoencoder-Classifier performance on unbalanced data:** This model showed exceptionally high performance, with an Accuracy of 0.9999, Precision of 0.9999, Recall of 1.0000, and F1-Score of 1.0000.\n","*   **Comparison with balanced data results:**\n","    *   MLP and LSTM models maintained perfect scores (1.0000 for all metrics) on both balanced and unbalanced datasets, suggesting that class imbalance did not visibly affect their performance for this task.\n","    *   The Autoencoder-Classifier, however, exhibited a very minor decrease in Accuracy (from a mean of 0.999997 on balanced data to 0.999925 on unbalanced data) and Precision (from 1.0 on balanced data to 0.99992 on unbalanced data), indicating a subtle impact of imbalance on this specific model.\n","\n","### Insights or Next Steps\n","*   The consistently near-perfect to perfect performance of all models, even on the imbalanced dataset, raises questions about potential data leakage or the inherent simplicity of the classification task with the current features. Further investigation into the dataset and feature engineering is recommended to confirm the robustness of these results.\n","*   The models are technically ready for deployment or further stages, but it would be prudent to validate them against a more diverse or challenging real-world dataset, or employ more advanced validation techniques, to ensure their generalizability beyond the current context.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"YNNwQpFjr_Fo"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8cef00c0"},"source":["# Task\n","Calculate and visualize the pairwise correlation matrix between features in `X_encoded` using a heatmap to identify highly correlated features."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0032d924"},"source":["## Calculate and Visualize Correlation Matrix\n","\n","### Subtask:\n","Calculate the pairwise correlation between features in `X_encoded` and visualize it using a heatmap.

Interestingly, the Autoencoder-Classifier, which showed a minor dip on full unbalanced data, recovered to a perfect 1.0000 F1-score on the selected unbalanced features.
